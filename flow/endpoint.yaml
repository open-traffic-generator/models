    Flow.TxRx:
      description: >-
        A container for different types of transmit and receive 
        endpoint containers.

      properties:
        choice:
          description: >-
            The type of transmit and receive container used by the flow.
          type: string
          enum: [port, device]
        port:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Flow.Port'
        device:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Flow.Device'

    Flow.Port:
      description: >-
        A container for a transmit port and 0..n intended receive ports.
        When assigning this container to a flow the flows's 
        packet headers will not be populated with any address resolution 
        information such as source and/or destination addresses. 
        For example Flow.Ethernet dst mac address values will be defaulted to 0. 
        For full control over the Flow.properties.packet header contents use this 
        container. 
      type: object
      required: [tx_name]
      properties:
        tx_name:
          description: >-
            The unique name of a port that is the transmit port.
          type: string
          x-constraint:
          - '/components/schemas/Port/properties/name'
          - '/components/schemas/Lag/properties/name'
        rx_name:
          description: >-
            The unique name of a port that is the intended receive port.
          type: string
          x-constraint:
          - '/components/schemas/Port/properties/name'
          - '/components/schemas/Lag/properties/name'

    Flow.Device:
      description: >-
        A container for 1..n transmit devices and 1..n receive devices.
        Implemementations may use learned information from the devices to 
        pre-populate Flow.properties.packet[Flow.Header fields].
        
        For example an implementation may automatically start devices, get arp 
        table information and pre-populate the Flow.Ethernet dst mac address values.

        To discover what the implementation supports use the 
        /results/capabilities API.
