            By default, simulated links are treated as Primary links , which means that the intention is for connected device to advertise this and full topology of devices connected to it.
            e.g. when advertised as ISIS Simulated Topology.

            All simulated links inside one topology subset would normally can point to only other unconnected devices in the same topology or to the 'root' emulated device.
            If a link is designated as secondary , only that link information will be advertised by the IGP e.g. ISIS , and not the entire topology behind it.
            The optional secondary option allows emulation of external link scenarios where a simulated device (e.g. part of a ISIS simulated topology ) is advertised as reachable part of the topology 
            by the emulated router behind which this is configured , as well as the other end of the secondary link which could be 
            - 1) either a simulated device behind a different emulated router.
            - 2) or an emulated router on same or different port.
            This allows emulation of scenarios where one device/router is emulated to be reachable from different Emulated Routers connected to the Device Under Test. (e.g. for FRR scenarios)

            If an implementation does not support multiple primary links from same simulated topology i.e. full topology advertised via multiple emulated routers, it should return an error 
            during set_config operation with such a topology.
