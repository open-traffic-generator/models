    Bgp.OneUpdateReplay:
      description: >-
        Specification of one BGP Update to be sent to the BGP peer.

        update_bytes:    
          description: >-
            Bytes specified in hex format to be sent to peer after the BGP Update Header. The Update Header will always have the 
            initial 16 bytes containing Marker bytes, 2 bytes containing the Length and 1 byte containing the Type.The string MUST 
            contain sequence of valid hex bytes.The bytes specified in hex format should be appended to the Update message to be sent 
            to the peer after the fixed 19 bytes described above. This byte stream can be of any length from 1 to 4077 bytes.The value 
            4077 is derived from the maximum length allowed for a BGP message in RFC4271 which is 4096 minus mandatory 19 bytes described 
            above. In the imported byte stream, one byte is represented as string of 2 characters, for example 2 character string (0x)AB 
            represents value of a single byte. So the maximum length of this attribute is 8154 (4077 * 2 hex characters per byte).
