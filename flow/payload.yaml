      description: >-
        A container for different types of payload, which is the data in the frame after protocol headers.
        
        Some part of the payload could be overwritten with instrumentation data, contents and placement of 
        which is implementation specific.

        choice:
          description: |-
            A choice used to determine the pattern of the bytes in the payload following the protocol headers.
            Example of expected behaviour of each choice is as mentioned below,
            - fixed: this would insert user defined pattern in the payload bytes.
            - increment_byte: this would set the first byte as 00, second as 01 and so on, upto ff and then the pattern would be repeated.
            - decrement_byte: this would set the first byte as ff, second as fe and so on, upto 00 and then the pattern would be repeated.
            - increment_word: this would set the first 2 bytes as 00 00, second as 00 01 and so on, upto ff ff and then the pattern would be repeated.
            - decrement_word: this would set the first 2 bytes as ff ff, second as ff fe and so on, upto 00 00 and then the pattern would be repeated.
