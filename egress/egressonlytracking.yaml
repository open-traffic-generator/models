      description: |-
        Egress tracking specification for a specified port. 
        An application which supports a single or limited number of egress tracking specifications for a single port 
        should return an error if the number of egress tracking specifications for a specific port or in total exceeds its capabilities.

            One or more metric tags can be used to enable tracking portion of or all bits
            in a corresponding header field for metrics per each applicable value.
            These would appear as tagged metrics in corresponding egress_only_tracking metrics.

            Specifies a rule which will be used to first filter received packets on this port 
            before applying the egress tracking metric_tags on them. 
            If multiple filters are provided, then an incoming packet MUST pass all the filters. 
            If the packet does not pass any filter, it is not considered for egress tracking.

            corresponding header field. When offset of tracked metric at Tx is more than 
            the offset at Rx, the difference should be configured as Tx offset adjustment.

            Currently two options are provided:
            none: All packets will be considered for egress only tracking.
            auto_macsec: This requires that MACsec enabled Ethernet interface should be configured on this port. 
            This filter will ensure that only packets with Ethernet Type set to MACsec (0x88E5) and 
            destined to traffic Rx device(s) will be considered for egress only tracking
