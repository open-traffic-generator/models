            The BGP router ID is a unique identifier used by routing protocols.
            It is a 32-bit value that is often represented by an IPv4 address.
          type: string
          format: ipv4
          default: 0.0.0.0

            The type of BGP autonomous system.
            External BGP is used for BGP links between two or more
            autonomous systems (ebgp)
            Internal BGP is used within a single autonomous system (ibgp).
            BGP property defaults are aligned with this object defined as an
            internal BGP peer.
            If the as_type is specified as ebgp then other properties will
            need to be specified according an external BGP peer.
