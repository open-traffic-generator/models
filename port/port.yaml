          description: >- 
            The location of a test port. 
            It is the endpoint where packets will emit from.

            Test port locations can be the following:
              - physical appliance with multiple ports
              - physical chassis with multiple cards and ports
              - local interface
              - virtual machine, docker container, kubernetes cluster

            The test port location format is implementation specific.
            Use the /results/capabilities API to determine what formats an 
            implementation supports for the location property.

            Get the configured location state by using the /results/port API.

            If the test ports defined by their location values are in use and 
            this value is true, the test ports will be preempted.
