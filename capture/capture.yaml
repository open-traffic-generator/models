            A list of filters to apply to the capturing ports.
            If no filters are specified then all packets will be captured.
            A capture can have multiple filters. The number of filters supported
            is determined by the implementation which can be retrieved using
            the capabilities API.

            When multiple filters are specified the capture implementation 
            must && (and) all the filters.
