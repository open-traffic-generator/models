    Device.IsisRouter.SegmentRoutingMPLS:
      description: |-
        Segment Routing (SR) turns on any node to select any path (explicit or derived from IGPs SPT computations) 
        for each of its traffic classes. The path does not depend on a hop-by-hop 
        signaling technique (unlike LDP or RSVP). 
        It only depends on a set of segments that are advertised by the IS-IS routing protocol. 
        These segments act as topological sub-paths that can be combined together to form the required path.

            This enable SRMPLS on ISIS emulated router.

        router_capability_id:
          description: |-
            A unique identifier (IPv4 /32 bit address format) for the ISIS router advertising. 
            In the context of ISIS segment routing, it helps to uniquely associate specific ISIS 
            capabilities related to segment routing (For example, SRGB, Algorithm, and so on.) with a specific ISIS router.
          type: string
          format: ipv4
          default: 1.1.1.1
        d_flag: 
          description: |-
            D Bit is added to prevent TLV looping. Refer RFC 4971 for more details.
            If D bit is set (that is, 1), Router Capability TLV 242 must not be leaked 
            from Level 1 to Level 2.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        s_flag: 
          description: |-
            If S bit is not set (that is, 0), ISIS Router Capability TLV 242 will 
            not be leaked through ISIS inter-area attachment points. Refer to RFC 4971 for more details.
            If S bt is set (that is, 1), ISIS Router Capability TLV 242 is flooded in the entire 
            routing domains (that is, across several inter-level attachment points).
          type: boolean
          default: false
        ipv4_flag: 
          description: |-

        redistribution:
          description: |-
            Defines the Up/Down (Redistribution) bit defined for TLVs 128 and 130 by RFC 2966.
            It is used for domain-wide advertisement of prefix information.
            If up - used when a prefix is initially advertised within the ISIS L3 hierarchy, and for all other prefixes in L1 and L2 LSPs. (default)
            When down - used when an L1/L2 router advertises L2 prefixes in L1 LSPs. 
            The prefixes are being advertised from a higher level (L2) down to a lower level (L1).
          type: string
