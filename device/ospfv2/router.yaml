        The OSPFv2 Options field is present Database Description packets and all LSAs.  
        This enables OSPF routers to support (or not support) optional capabilities, 
        and to communicate their capability level to other OSPF routers.
        When capabilities are exchanged in Database Description packets a
        router can choose not to forward certain LSAs to a neighbor because
        of its reduced functionality.
        Reference: A.2 The Options field: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2328#page-46.
