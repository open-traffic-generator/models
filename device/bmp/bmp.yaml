        The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) is a protocol used to monitor Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) sessions on routers. 
        It allows a monitoring station, or BMP server, to receive routing information, including all received routes 
        (Adj-RIB-In) and routes sent to peers (Adj-RIB-Out), from a BGP-enabled router (BMP client). BMP is unidirectional, 
        meaning the monitoring station only receives information; it doesn't send commands or control the monitored router. .
