        choice:
          description: Currently only auto choice is allowed. If choice is auto, MACsec header is autogenerated. If auto choice is selected, MACsec protocol must be configured in device; flow.tx_rx.choice must be of type 'device' and flow.tx_rx.device.tx_names[0] must be chosen to be an endpoint that is on or behind a MACSec enabled ethernet to be able to correctly auto-fill the fields of the MACsec header. If one of the conditions is not true, the implementation should return an error specifying the issue. A custom choice can be added in future to allow user to set specific MACsec header fields and/ or to generate flow.tx_rx.port type of traffic with MACSec header fields explicitly specified by the user.
