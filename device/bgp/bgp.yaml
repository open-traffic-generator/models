            The BGP router ID is a unique identifier used by routing protocols.

            The type of BGP autonomous system.
            External BGP is used for BGP links between two or more
            autonomous systems (ebgp)
            Internal BGP is used within a single autonomous system (ibgp).
            BGP property defaults are aligned with this object defined as an
            internal BGP peer.

            need to be specified according an external BGP peer.
