           when line_rate mode is chosen, it is required that all flows with a tx endpoint on such a port
            must choose line_rate mode. In this case, all the rdma flows will transmit data in interleaved manner based
             on qp.message size as fast as possible but not exceeding the line_rate value configured.
             If burst_mode is chosen, all flows with Tx endpoint on a port should be configured in burst_mode.
              Then each rdma flows sends packets as per rocev2_flow_settings.message_size configuration
               for fixed / infinite times with burst_gap time between each iteration.
