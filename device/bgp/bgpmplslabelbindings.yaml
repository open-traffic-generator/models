        BGP may be used to advertise that a particular node (N) has bound a particular MPLS label, or a particular sequence of MPLS labels, 
        to a particular address prefix.
        This is done by sending a Multiprotocol BGP UPDATE message with with an MP_REACH_NLRI attribute. 
        The Network Address of Next Hop field of that attribute contains an IP address of node N.

            Bind one or more MPLS Labels or SR indices to Address Prefixes.
            To advertise multiple labels for an address prefix, the BGP capabilities device.bgp.capabliti.ipv4_mpls_multi/bgp.capabliti.ipv6_mpls_multi etc. to be configured first.
            - labels: One or more Label Values are to be configured here.
            - sr_labels: One or more SR indices are to be configured here. At least one SRGB range has been configured in device.bgp.mpls_srgb_ranges.
