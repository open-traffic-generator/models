        refresh_interval:
          description: >-
            The time in seconds between successive transmissions of RESV Refreshes.
            The actual refresh interval is jittered by upto 50%.
            There is no specification specified maximum value. For clarity, setting the maximum to 1 hour.

        timeout_multiplier:
          description: >-
            The number of missed PATH refreshes after which a recieving node should consider the LSP state to have timed out.
            There is no specification specified maximum value. Setting the maximum allowed value to 10.
          type: integer
          default: 3

        reservation_style:
          description: >-
            It determines how RSVP-TE enabled network devices set up reservations along the path between an end-to-end 
            QOS-enabled connection. If 'auto' is enabled, the style is chosen based on whether the incoming Path has 'SE Desired'
            flag set. Otherwise, the style is chosen based on the value selected for this attribute.

        enable_fixed_label:
          description: >-
            If enabled, a specific fixed label will be advertised by the egress or tail end for all Path messages received by this egress. 
            This can be leveraged to advertise Explicit or Implicit null labels.            
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 5
        fixed_label_value:
          description: >-
             The fixed label value as advertised by egress in RESV message. Applicable only if 'fixed_label' is set to 'true'.
             Special values are '0 - IPv4 Explicit NULL', '2 - IPv6 Explicit NULL' and '3 - Implicit NULL'.  
             Outside of this, labels are expected to have a minimum value of 16.
