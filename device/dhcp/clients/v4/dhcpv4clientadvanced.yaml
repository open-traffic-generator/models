        Advanced configuration of DHCPv4 Client.
      type: object
      properties:
        client_port:
          description: >-
            The UDP port on which the client listens for DHCP and BOOTP responses.
            The default value port number is 68.
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          minimum: 1
          maximum: 65535
          default: 68
          x-field-uid: 1
        server_port:
          description: >-
            The Destination UDP port to which the client sends DHCP messages.
            The default value port number is 67.
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          minimum: 1
          maximum: 65535
          default: 67
          x-field-uid: 2
        discovery_timeout:
          description: >-
            The initial timeout, in seconds, that the subnet waits to receive a response from a DHCP server.
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          minimum: 1
          maximum: 65535
          default: 4
          x-field-uid: 3
        discovery_timeout_factor:
          description: >-
            The value by which the timeout value is multiplied each time the response timeout was reached. 
            For example, if a DHCPDISCOVER times out in 4 seconds, and the Discover Timeout Factor is 2, 
            the timeout is 8 seconds (4 times 2) the next time a DHCPDISCOVER is sent.
            The maximum time between DHCP Discover messages is around 64 seconds as defined by RFC 2131.
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          minimum: 1
          maximum: 100
          default: 2
          x-field-uid: 4
        max_discover_timeout:
          description: >-
            The maximum discover time period in seconds between DHCP Discover reattempt messages. 
            This value is being obtained by factoring in the Discover Timeout Factor parameter.
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          minimum: 1
          maximum: 10000
          default: 64
          x-field-uid: 5
        discover_reattempts:
          description: >-
            Number of times that the client will retransmit a request for which it has not been received a response.
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 100
          default: 3
