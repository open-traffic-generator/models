        route_refresh:
          description: >-
            Support for the route refresh capabilities.
            Route Refresh allows the dynamic exchange of route refresh requests  and
            routing information between BGP peers and the subsequent re-advertisement  of
            the outbound or inbound routing table.
          type: boolean

          x-field-uid: 6
        route_constraint:
          description: >-
            Supports for the route constraint capabilities.
            Route Constraint allows the advertisement of Route Target Membership  information.
            The BGP peers exchange Route Target Reachability Information,  which is
            used to build a route distribution graph.  This limits the propagation
            of VPN Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) between different
            autonomous systems  or distinct clusters of the same autonomous system.
            This is supported for Layer 3 Virtual Private Network scenario.
