          description: |-
            If a padded Hello message is received on the interface, the length of

          description: |-
            If a Level 1 Hello is received on this emulated router for an area 
            not currently in its area list, an area from the received Hello is 
            added to that list. This ensures an area match for all future 
            Level 1 Hellos from the source L1 router.
