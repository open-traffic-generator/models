        Configuration for emulated DHCPv6 Client on a single Interface. If the DHCPv6 Client receives one or more 
        DHCPv6 ADVERTISE messages from one or more servers then the client chooses one server from which to request 
        configuration parameters, based on the configuration parameters offered by the server in the DHCPv6 ADVERTISE 
        messages. If all configuration parameters match then the first server will be chosen.
