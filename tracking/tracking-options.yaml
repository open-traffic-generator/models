            If a packet does not match the filter it will not be considered for egress tracking.
            Currently two options are provided:
            none: All packets will be considered for egress only tracking.
            auto.macsec: This requires that macsec enabled Ethernet interface should be configured on this port. 
            This filter will ensure that only packets with Ethernet Type set to MacSec ( 0x88E5) will be considered for egress only tracking 
            and other packets will be filtered out for the purpose of egress only tracking.
