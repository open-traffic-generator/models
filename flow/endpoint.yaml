      description: >-

        endpoint containers.

        choice:
          description: >-
            The type of transmit and receive container used by the flow.

    Flow.Port:
      description: >-
        A container for a transmit port and 0..n intended receive ports.
        When assigning this container to a flow the flows's 
        packet headers will not be populated with any address resolution 
        information such as source and/or destination addresses. 
        For example Flow.Ethernet dst mac address values will be defaulted to 0. 
        For full control over the Flow.properties.packet header contents use this 
        container.

      required: [tx_name]
      properties:
        tx_name:
          description: >-
            The unique name of a port that is the transmit port.

    Flow.Device:
      description: >-
        A container for declaring a map of 1..n transmit devices
        to 1..n receive devices. This allows for a single flow to have 
        different tx to rx device flows such as a single one to one map or a 
        many to many map.
      type: object
      required: [maps]
      properties:
        maps:
          description: >-
            A list of tx to rx device mappings
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Flow.Device.Map'

    Flow.Device.Map:
      description: >-
        A container for declaring a one to one map of a transmit device
        to a receive device.

        Implemementations may use learned information from the devices to 
        pre-populate Flow.properties.packet[Flow.Header fields].
        
        For example an implementation may automatically start devices, get arp 
        table information and pre-populate the Flow.Ethernet dst mac address values.
