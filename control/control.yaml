            BGP NOTIFICATION messages are used for error reporting between BGP peers. Each message contains an Error Code field that indicates what type of problem occurred. 
            For certain Error Codes, an Error Subcode field provides additional details about the specific nature of the problem. The choice name will provide the Error Code 
            used in NOTIFICATION message. The Subcode can be set from each of the corresponding errors except for Hold Timer Expired error and BGP Finite State Machine error. 
            In both these cases Subcode 0 will be send. If a user wants to use non zero Sub Code then CustomError can be used. If a system does not receive successive KEEPALIVE, 
            UPDATE, and/or NOTIFICATION messages within the period specified in the Hold Time field of the OPEN message, then the NOTIFICATION message with the Hold Timer Expired 
            Error Code(Error Code 4) is sent and the BGP connection is closed. Similarly  any error detected by the BGP Finite State Machine (e.g., receipt of 
            an unexpected event) is indicated by sending the NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code-Finite State Machine Error(Error Code 5).
