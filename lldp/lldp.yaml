      properties:
        system_name:
          description: >-
            The name of the local system. For all ports in a LAG the system name should
            be same and for all devices in a device the name should be same.
            If two or more of the LLDP interfaces are configured on members of same LAG port , 
            it is expected that the System Name will be set to same name to ensure proper emulation 
            of LLDP behaviour when running on different members of the same LAG. If two or more of 
            the LLDP interfaces are configured on emulated interfaces which are part of the same device , 
            it is expected that the System Name will be set to same name to ensure proper emulation 
            of LLDP behaviour when running on different emulated interfaces belonging to the same device.
            The value set in this will be used to populate the System Name TLV in the LLDP PDUs sent 
            on the corresponding member port or emulated interface.
