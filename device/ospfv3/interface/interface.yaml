    Ospfv3Interface.Options:
      description: |-
        The Options field is present in OSPFv3 Hello packets, Database Description packets and all LSAs.
        The Options field enables OSPF routers to support (or not support) optional capabilities, and to
        communicate their capability level to other OSPF routers (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2740#appendix-A.2).
        When used in Hello packets, the Options field allows a router to reject a neighbor because of a capability mismatch.
