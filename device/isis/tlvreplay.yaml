            Tlv hex bytes consists of type filed (one byte), length field (one byte) and value/data of variable lengths. Length in unit of bytes, is given in one byte length field. 
            Therefore the value can be maximum 255 bytes length.
            The string MUST contains sequence of valid hex bytes. In the imported byte stream, one byte is represented as string of 2 characters, for example 2 character string (0x)AB 
            represents value of a single byte. So the maximum length of this attribute is 512 (256 * 2 hex characters per byte) plus two, i.e 514.

          pattern: '^[A-Fa-f0-9: ]+$'
          minLength: 2
          maxLength: 514
