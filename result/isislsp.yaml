            LSP ID in the format, e.g. '640000000001-00-00'.
            LSP ID consists of the System ID of a neighbor, the Pseudonode ID, and
            the LSP number.
            The last two bytes represent Pseudonode ID and LSP number respectively.
            A pseudonode is a logical representation of the LAN which is generated
            by a Designated Intermediate System (DIS)
            on a LAN segment. If one LSP exceeds the maximum LSP size then it is sent
            in another LSP with the LSP number incremented by one.
            A router's learned LSP gets refreshed by 'remaining_lifetime'. Then the
            sequence number is incremented by 1.
