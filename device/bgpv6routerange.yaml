            The number of route ranges per parent bgpv4 device.

            If creating sequential routes the range count should default to 1
            and the address_count can be used to create a range of  
            
            If the parent device_count is 6 and the range_count is 2 that means 
            there will be 2 route_range entries for every device for a total 
            of 12 route ranges.
            Any child patterns will be applied across the total number of 
            route ranges which implies a pattern count of 12.
