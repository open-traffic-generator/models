            The 'client identifier' is an opaque key; for example, the 'client identifier' may contain a client hardware address 
            or it may contain another type of identifier, such as a DNS name. The 'client identifier' chosen by a DHCP client 
            MUST be unique to that client within the subnet to which the client is attached. 
            If the client uses a 'client identifier' in one message, it MUST use that same identifier in all subsequent
            messages, to ensure that all servers correctly identify the client.
