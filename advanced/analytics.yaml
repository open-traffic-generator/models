            A list of flow groups to apply to all flow metrics.
            An empty list will return metrics for all flows.

            The list of metric names that the returned result set will contain.
            If the list is empty then all metrics will be returned.
            The name of the flow cannot be excluded from the response.

            The convergence time measured from the data plane perspective only. 
            It measures the time from BTT, when the rate on Test Port 2 crosses 
            below the Rx Threshold until an acceptable amount of traffic was 
            received at time ATT, when the rate crosses above the configured 
            rx_rate_threshold.

            The total convergence time, between the event that caused the
            switchover (at tEvent) until an acceptable amount of traffic was 
            received at time ATT, when the rate crosses above the configured 
            rx_rate_threshold.
