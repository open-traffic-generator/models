        This contains the properties of IS-IS Prefix-SID and its attributes for 
        the extended Ipv4 and Ipv6 reachability.

            Choice of whether Prefix-SID carries and absolute value or a relative index to the SRGB/SRLB Ranges.

            - sid_values: Prefix-SID carries one or more values and then v_flag is set by the implementation.

        r_flag:
          description: |-
            R-Flag: Re-advertisement Flag. 
            If set, then the prefix to which this Prefix-SID is attached has been propagated by the router 
            from either another level (i.e., from Level-1 to Level-2 or the opposite) or redistribution (e.g., from another protocol).
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 4
        n_flag: 
          description: |-
            N-Flag: Node-SID flag.  
            If set, then the Prefix-SID refers to the router identified by the prefix. 
            Typically, the N-Flag is set on Prefix-SIDs that are attached to a router loopback address. 
            The N-Flag is set when the Prefix-SID is a Node-SID as described in [RFC8402].
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 5
        p_flag: 
          description: |-
            P-Flag: No-PHP (No Penultimate Hop-Popping) Flag.
            If set, then the penultimate hop MUST NOT pop the Prefix-SID before delivering the packet to the node that advertised the Prefix-SID.
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 6
        e_flag: 
          description: |-
            E-Flag: Explicit-Null Flag.
            If set, any upstream neighbor of the Prefix-SID originator MUST replace the Prefix-SID with a Prefix-SID 
            that has an Explicit NULL value (0 for IPv4 and 2 for IPv6) before forwarding the packet.
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 7
        l_flag:
          description: |-
            The local flag. If set, then the value/index carried by
            the Prefix-SID has local significance and the Prefix SID is from Please refer to device.isis.segment_routing.router_capability.srlb_ranges.

          description: |-
            The Isis may use various algorithms when calculating reachability to other nodes or to prefixes attached to these nodes.
