            The authentication method.
            - md5 - Cryptographic authentication.
            - clear_text - Simple password authentication. A 64-bit field is configured on a per-network basis. 
              All packets sent on a particular network must have this configured value (in clear text) 
              in their OSPF header 64-bit authentication field.

    Ospfv2Authentication.Md5:
      description: |-
        Container of Cryptographic authentication. 
        If the authentication type is of 'md5' then 'md5_key_id' and 'md5_key' 
        both are to be configured. A shared secret key is configured in all routers attached to a common network/subnet.
        For each OSPF protocol packet, the key is used to generate/verify a "message digest" that is appended to the end
        of the OSPF packet.
