      description: >-
        Configuration for the optional RSVP-TE FAST_REROUTE object included in Path Messages as defined in RFC4090. 
      type: object
      properties:
        setup_priority:
          description: >-
            Specifies the value of the Setup Priority field. This controls whether the backup LSP should pre-empt existing
            LSP that is setup with certain Holding Priority. While setting up a backup LSP, preemption of existing LSP can happen 
            if resource limitation is encountered (e.g bandwidth availability).
          type: integer
          default: 7
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 7
          x-field-uid: 1
        holding_priority:
          description: >-
            Specifies the value of the Holding Priority field. This controls whether a new LSP being created with certain Setup Priority
            should pre-empt this LSP set up with this Holding Priority. While setting up a new LSP, preemption of existing LSP can happen 
            if resource limitation is encountered (e.g bandwidth availability).            
          type: integer
          default: 7
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 7
          x-field-uid: 2
        hop_limit:
          description: >-
            Specifies the value of the Hop Limit field. This controls the maximum number of hops the LSP should traverse to reach the 
            LSP end-point.
          type: integer
          default: 3
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 255
          x-field-uid: 3
        bandwidth:
          description: >-
            Specifies the value of the Bandwidth field as a 32-bit IEEE floating point integer, in
            bytes per second, as desired for the LSP. 
          type: number
          format: float

            unacceptable. A null set (all bits set to zero) doesn't render the link unacceptable.
            The most significant byte in the hex-string is the farthest  to the left in the byte sequence. 
            Leading zero bytes in the configured value may be omitted for brevity.

            A 32-bit vector representing a set of attribute filters associated with a tunnel all of which must be present for a
