      description: >-
        This attribute identifies the autonomous systems through  which routing information
        carried in this UPDATE message has passed.
        This contains the configuration of how to include the Local AS in the AS path
        attribute of the MP REACH NLRI. It also contains optional configuration of
        additional
        AS Path Segments that can be included in the AS Path attribute.
        The AS Path consists of a Set or Sequence of Autonomous Systems (AS) numbers  that
        a routing information passes through to reach the destination.

            Defines how the Local AS should be included in the MP REACH NLRI.
            For iBGP sessions, "Do Not Include Local AS" must be chosen.
            For eBGP sessions, any choice other than "Do Not Include Local AS" can
            be chosen.

            AS sequence is the most common type of AS_PATH, it contains the  list
            of ASNs starting with the most recent ASN being added read  from left
            to right.

            The other three AS_PATH types are used for Confederations
            - AS_SET is the type of AS_PATH attribute that summarizes routes using
            using the aggregate-address command, allowing AS_PATHs to be  summarized
            in the update as well.
            - AS_CONFED_SEQ gives the list of ASNs in the path starting with the  most
            recent ASN to be added reading left to right
            - AS_CONFED_SET will allow summarization of multiple AS PATHs to be  sent
            in BGP Updates.
