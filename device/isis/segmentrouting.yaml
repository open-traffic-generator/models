      description: |-
        Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, 
        called "segments". These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF). 
        Prefix segments represent an ECMP-aware shortest path to a prefix (or a node), as per the state of the IGP topology. 
        Adjacency segments represent a hop over a specific adjacency between two nodes in the IGP. 
        A prefix segment is typically a multi-hop path while an adjacency segment, in most of the cases, is a one-hop path. 
        These segments act as topological sub-paths that can be combined together to form the required path.

        The SR Local Block (SRLB) sub-TLV contains the range of labels the node has reserved for Local SIDs. 
        Local SIDs are used for Adjacency SIDs or locally significant Prefix SIDs and may also be allocated by components other than the IS-IS protocol. 
        As an example, an application or a controller may instruct the router to allocate a specific Local SID. Therefore, 
        in order for such applications or controllers to know what Local SIDs are available in the router, 
        it is required that the router advertises its SRLB.
