    Router.IsisInterface.LinkProtection:
      description: |-
        Optional container for the link protection sub TLV (type 20).
      type: object
      properties:
        extra_traffic:
          description: |-
            Enable this to protect other link or links. LSPs on a link of this type are lost
            if any of the links fail.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        unprotected:
          description: |-
            Enabling this signifies that there is no other link protecting this 
            link. LSPs on a link of this type are lost if the link fails.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        shared:
          description: |-
            Enable this to share the Extra Traffic links between one or more 
            links of type Shared.There are one or more disjoint links of type 
            Extra Traffic that are protecting this link.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        dedicated_1_to_1:
          description: |-
            Enabling this signifies that there is one dedicated disjoint link 
            of type Extra Traffic that is protecting this link.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        dedicated_1_plus_1:
          description: |-
            Enabling this signifies that a dedicated disjoint link is protecting 
            this link. However, the protecting link is not advertised in the 
            link state database and is therefore not available for the routing 
            of LSPs.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        enhanced:
          description: |-
            Enabling this signifies that a protection scheme that is more 
            reliable than Dedicated 1+1.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        reserved_40:
          description: |-
            This is a Protection Scheme with value 0x40. 
          type: boolean
          default: false
        reserved_80:
          description: |-
            This is a Protection Scheme with value 0x80. 
          type: boolean
