        container_name: 
          description: >-
            The unique name of a Port or Lag object that will contain the 
            emulated interfaces and/or devices.
          type: string
          x-constraint:
          - '/components/schemas/Port/properties/name'
          - '/components/schemas/Lag/properties/name'
        device_count:
          description: >-
            The number of emulated protocol devices or interfaces per port.
            
            For example if the device_count is 10 and the choice property value is ethernet 
            then an implementation MUST create 10 ethernet interfaces.
            The ethernet property is a container for src, dst and eth_type 
            properties with each on of those properties being a pattern container 
            for 10 possible values.  

            If an implementation is unable to support the maximum device_count
            it MUST indicate what the maximum device_count is using the 
            /results/capabilities API.

            The device_count is also used by the individual child properties 
            that are a container for a /components/schemas/Device.Pattern.
