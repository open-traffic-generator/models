          description: |-
            Enables flow metrics.
            Enabling this option may affect the resultant packet payload due to 
            additional instrumentation data.

    Flow.Latency.Metrics:
      description: |-
        The optional container for per flow latency metric configuration.
      type: object
      properties:
        enable:
          description: |-
            True to enable latency metrics using timestamps.

            Enabling this option may affect the resultant packet payload due to 
            additional instrumentation data.
          type: boolean

        mode:
          description: |-
            Select the type of latency measurement. The different types of 
            latency measurements are:
            

            store_forward:
            The time interval starting when the last bit of the frame leaves the
            sending port and ending when the first bit of the frame is seen on
            the receiving port (LIFO).  This is based on the RFC 1242 standard.


            cut_through:
            The time interval starting when the first bit of the frame leaves
            the sending port and ending when the first bit of the frame is seen
            on the receiving port (FIFO).  This is based on the RFC 1242 
            standard.
