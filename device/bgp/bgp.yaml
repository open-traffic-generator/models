          description: >-
            The type of BGP autonomous system.
            External BGP is used for BGP links between two or more
            autonomous systems (ebgp).
            Internal BGP is used within a single autonomous system (ibgp).
            BGP property defaults are aligned with this object defined as an
            internal BGP peer.
            If the as_type is specified as 'ebgp' then other properties will
            need to be specified as per an external BGP peer.
            Specifically, for 'ebgp',  'as_set_mode' attribute in 'as_path' field  in
            any Route Range should be changed from default value 'do_not_include_local_as'
            to any other value.
