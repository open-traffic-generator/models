            A manually configured IPv6 gateway address. The default value ::0, meaning that no manual gateway IP 
            is specified. If the DHCPv6 Client receives from a server a response packet with a Router 
            Address TLV specifying another gateway address than this manually configured gateway IP, 
            then this TLV is ignored. Whenever a manual non default gateway IP is configured, the client will use 
            it as gateway address for traffic outside of its network. otherwise client uses the gateway IP address 
            learned from the server.
