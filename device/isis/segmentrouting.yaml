    Isis.SegmentRouting:
      description: |-
        Segment Routing (SR) turns on any node to select any path (explicit or derived from IGPs SPT computations) 
        for each of its traffic classes. The path does not depend on a hop-by-hop 
        signaling technique (unlike LDP or RSVP). 
        It only depends on a set of segments that are advertised by the IS-IS routing protocol. 
        These segments act as topological sub-paths that can be combined together to form the required path.

        As an example, an application or a controller may instruct the router to allocate a specific Local SID. Therefore, 
        in order for such applications or controllers to know what Local SIDs are available in the router, 
        it is required that the router advertises its SRLB.
