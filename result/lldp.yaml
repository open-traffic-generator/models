            The names of LLDP interfaces to return results for.
            An empty list will return results for all LLDP interfaces.

            The requested list of column names for the result set.
            If the list is empty then metrics for all columns will be returned.
            The name of LLDP interface can not be excluded.

            Number of LLDP frames received with packet errors. This stat

          description: >-
            Number of LLDP frames received that are discarded. This stat
            should be incremented when one or more of the three mandatory 
            TLVs at the beginning of the LLDPDU is missing, out of order or 
            contains an out of range information string length. This stat
            should follow the validation rules in section 10.3.2 of IEEE 
            Std 802.1 AB-2005.

          description: >-
            Number of LLDP tlvs received that are discarded. If any TLV contains 
            an error condition specific for that particular TLV or if any TLV 
            extends past the physical end of the frame then these TLVs will be discarded.

        tlvs_unknown:
          description: >-
            Number of LLDP unknown tlvs received. If the OUI of the organizationlly specific
            TLV and/or organizationally defined subtype are not recognized,or if TLV type 
            value is in the range of reserved TLV types then these TLVs will be considered as 
            unknown TLVs.
