            Bytes specified in hex format to be sent to peer after the BGP Update Header. The Update Header will always have the initial 16 bytes 
            containing Marker bytes, 2 bytes containing the Length and 1 byte containing the Type.The string MUST contain sequence of valid hex bytes.
            The bytes specified in hex format should be appended to the Update message to be sent to the peer after the fixed 19 bytes described above. 
            This byte stream can be of any length from 1 to 4077 bytes.The maximum length of 8154 (4077 * 2 hex characters per byte) is obtained from the 
            maximum length allowed for a BGP message in RFC4271 which is 4096 minus mandatory 19 bytes described above.
