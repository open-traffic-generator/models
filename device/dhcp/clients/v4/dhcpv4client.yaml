            The client receives one or more DHCPOFFER messages from one or more servers. The client may choose to wait for multiple responses.
            The client chooses one server from which to request configuration
            parameters, based on the configuration parameters offered in the DHCPOFFER messages.
            use_first_server: if selected, the subnet accepts the IP addresses offered by the first server to respond with an offer of IP addresses.
            use_server_address: The address of the DHCP server from which the subnet will accept IP addresses.
            server address to 0.0.0.0, implementation will use the services of the first DHCP server that responds to the DHCP Lease Request message.

        gateway_ip: 
          description: >-
            A manually configured IPv4 gateway address. 
            The default value 0.0.0.0, meaning that no manual gateway IP address is specified.
            If the DHCPv4 Client receives from a server a response packet with a Router Address TLV 
            specifying another gateway address than the manually configured gateway IP, 
            then this TLV is ignored. 
            Whenever a manual non default gateway IP is configured, the client will use it as gateway address 
            for traffic outside of its network; 
            otherwise client uses the gateway IP address learned from the server.

            In case of non default, ARP messages are sent to resolve the gateway MAC address.
