        enable_attached_bit:
          description: >-
            If the Attached bit is enabled, it indicates that the ISIS router is attached
            to another area  or the Level 2 backbone. The purpose of an Attached-Bit
            is to accomplish Inter-Area Routing.  When an L1/L2 router is connected
            to more than one area, it sets the Attached-bit on its L1 LSP.
            This can cause a default route ( 0.0.0.0/0 ) to be installed by the receiving
            router.
          type: boolean
