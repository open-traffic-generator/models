      description: A Sequence of two fields, an object_identifier and the value for/from that object_identifier.

          description: >-
              This points to a particular parameter in the SNMP agent. 
              The first rule applies when encoding the first two numbers in the OID. 
              According to BER, the first two numbers of any OID (x.y) are encoded as one value using the formula (40*x)+y. 
              Example, the first two numbers of an SNMP OID 1.3... are encoded as 43 or 0x2B, because (40*1)+3 = 43. 
              After the first two numbers are encoded, the subsequent numbers in the OID are each encoded as a byte. 
              However, a special rule is required for large numbers because one byte can only represent a number from 0-255. 
              For example, the number 2680 in the OID '1.3.6.1.4.1.2680.1.2.7.3.2.0' cannot be encoded using a single byte. 
              The rule for large numbers states that only the lower 7 bits in the byte are used for holding the value (0-127). 
              The highest order bit is used as a flag to let the recipient know that this number spans more than one byte. 
              Therefore, any number over 127 must be encoded using more than one byte. 
              According to this rule, the number 2680 must be encoded 0x94 0x78. 
              Since the most significant bit is set in the first byte (0x94), the recipient knows to use the lower 7 bits from each byte (0x14 and 0x78) and decode the two bytes as (0x14 *128) + 0x78 = 2680.
              For these large numbers the most significant bit is not set in the last byte indicating the end of the number.
