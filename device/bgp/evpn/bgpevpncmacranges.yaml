            The Extended Communities Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute, with the Type Code 16. Community and Extended Communities  attributes
            are utilized to trigger routing decisions, such as acceptance, rejection,  preference, or redistribution. An extended community is an 8-Bytes value.
            It is divided into two main parts. The first 2 Bytes of the community encode a type and sub-type fields and the last 6 Bytes carry a unique set
            of data in a format defined by the type and sub-type field. Extended communities provide a larger  range for grouping or categorizing communities.
            When type is administrator_as_2octet or administrator_as_4octet, the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for 
            administrator_as_2octet and administrator_as_4octet type is either two byte AS followed by four byte local administrator id or four byte AS followed by two 
            byte local administrator id. 
            When type is administrator_ipv4_address the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for 
            administrator_ipv4_address is a four byte IPv4 address followed by a two byte local administrator id. 
            When type is opaque, valid sub types are color and encapsulation. When sub type is color, first two bytes of the value field contain flags and last four bytes 
            contains the value of the color. When sub type is encapsulation the first four bytes of value field are reserved and last two bytes carries the tunnel type from 
            IANA's "ETHER TYPES" registry e.g IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847).
            When type is administrator_as_2octet_link_bandwidth the valid sub type is extended_bandwidth. The first two bytes of the value
            field contains the AS number and the last four bytes contains the bandwidth in IEEE floating point format. 
            When type is evpn the valid subtype is mac_address. In the value field the low-order bit of the first byte(Flags) is defined as
            the "Sticky/static" flag and may be set to 1, indicating the MAC address is static and cannot move. The second byte is reserved and the 
            last four bytes contain the sequence number which is used to ensure that PEs retain the correct MAC/IP Advertisement route when multiple updates 
            occur for the same MAC address.
