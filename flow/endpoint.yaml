    Flow.TxRx:
      description: |-
        A container for different types of transmit and receive 
        endpoint containers.
      type: object
      properties:
        choice:
          description: |-
            The type of transmit and receive container used by the flow.
          type: string
          enum: [port, device]
          default: port
        port:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Flow.Port'
        device:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Flow.Device'

    Flow.Port:
      description: |-
        A container for a transmit port and 0..n intended receive ports.
        When assigning this container to a flow the flows's 
        packet headers will not be populated with any address resolution 
        information such as source and/or destination addresses. 
        For example Flow.Ethernet dst mac address values will be defaulted to 0. 
        For full control over the Flow.properties.packet header contents use this 
        container. 
      type: object
      required: [tx_name]
      properties:
        tx_name:
          description: |-
            The unique name of a port that is the transmit port.

          - '/components/schemas/Port/properties/name'
          - '/components/schemas/Lag/properties/name'
        rx_name:
          description: |-
            The unique name of a port that is the intended receive port.

          - '/components/schemas/Lag/properties/name'

    Flow.Device:
      description: |-
        A container for declaring a map of 1..n transmit devices
        to 1..n receive devices. This allows for a single flow to have 
        different tx to rx device flows such as a single one to one map or a 
        many to many map.
      type: object
      required: [tx_names, rx_names]
      properties:
        mode:
          description: |-
            Determines the mapping of tx_names to rx_names.

            The mesh mode creates traffic between each value in tx_names to
            every value in rx_names except in the case where the individual 
            tx_names value is equal to rx_names value which will be ignored.
            Identical values in tx_names or rx_names MUST raise an error.

            The one_to_one mode creates traffic between each value pair in 
            of tx_names and rx_names by index.
            The length of tx_names and rx_name MUST be the same.
            Identical values in tx_names or rx_names MUST raise an error.
          type: string
          enum: [mesh, one_to_one]
          default: mesh
        tx_names:
          description: |-
            The system will use information from the supplied tx_names to populate the following
            flow.packet.header fields if they are present:
              - ethernet.dst using device ipv4 addresses from either interfaces, route ranges etc.
              - ethernet.src using ethernet.mac addresses from ethernet interfaces
              - ipv4.src using device ipv4 addresses from either interfaces, route ranges etc.

            If the flow.packet.header fields above have been set to a value other than the default value
            the system will NOT populate those fields.
          type: array
          items:
            description: |-
              The unique name of an emulated device that will be transmitting.

          - '/components/schemas/Device.Bgpv6RouteRange/properties/name'
          example: ['Eth 1', 'Eth 2', 'Eth 3']
        rx_names:
          description: |-
            The system will use information from the supplied rx_names to populate the following
            flow.packet.header fields if they are present:
              - ipv4.dst using device ipv4 addresses from either interfaces, route ranges etc.
              
            If the flow.packet.header fields above have been set to a value other than the default value
            the system will NOT resolve those fields.
          type: array
          items:
            description: |-
              The unique name of an emulated device that will be receiving.
