            The convergence time(microseconds) measured from the data plane perspective only. 
            It measures the time w.r.t. last start of the traffic of the affected flow from Below Threshold Timestamp, 
            when the rate on Test Port 2 crosses below the Rx Threshold until an acceptable amount of traffic was 
            received at time Above Threshold Timestamp, when the rate crosses above the configured 
            rx_rate_threshold.
