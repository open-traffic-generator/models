      description: |-
        Egress tracking specification for a specified port. 
        An application which supports a single or limited number of egress tracking specifications for a single port 
        should return an error if the number of egress tracking specifications for a specific port or in total exceeds its capabilities.

            These would appear as tagged metrics in corresponding egress_only_tracking metrics.

            Specifies a rule which will be used to first filter received packets on this port 
            before applying the egress tracking metric_tags on them. 
            If multiple filters are provided, then an incoming packet MUST pass all the filters. 
            If the packet does not pass any filter, it is not considered for egress tracking.

            Currently two options are provided:
            none: All packets will be considered for egress only tracking.
            auto_macsec: This requires that MACsec enabled Ethernet interface should be configured on this port. 
            This filter will ensure that only packets with Ethernet Type set to MACsec (0x88E5) and 
            destined to traffic Rx device(s) will be considered for egress only tracking
