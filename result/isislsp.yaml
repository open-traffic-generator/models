            LSP ID is consist of the System ID of a neighbor, the Pseudonode ID, and the LSP number of the LSPs.
            The last two bytes respectively represent Pseudonode ID and LSP number.
            A pseudonode is a logical representation of the LAN which is generated by a Designated Intermediate System (DIS)
            on a LAN segment. If one LSP is not fit by maximum LSP size then thats sent in another LSP with LSP number
            is incremented by 1.
            A router's learned LSP gets refreshed by 'remaining_lifetime'. Then the sequence number is incremented by 1.
