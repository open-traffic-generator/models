      description: >-
        This contains the properties of IS-IS Prefix-SID and its attributes for 
        the extended Ipv4 and Ipv6 reachability.
        Refernce: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8667#name-prefix-segment-identifier-p.
      type: object
      properties:
        choice:
          description: |-
            The choice of Prefix-SID carries a value instead of an index.
            Refer to "srgb_ranges" under IsisSR.Srlb under Isis.RouterCapability and IsisSR.Srgb under Isis.SRCapability.
            - sid_value: Prefix-SID carries a value
            - sid_index: Prefix-SID carries an index.
          type: string
          default: sid_value
          x-field-uid: 1
          x-enum:

              x-field-uid: 2
        sid:
          description: >-
            SID/Index is the SID/Label value associated 
            with the IGP Prefix segment attached to the specific IPv4 or IPv6 prefix.
            Refer to IsisSR.Srlb and IsisSR.Srgb
          type: integer
          format: uint32
          default: 0
          x-field-uid: 2     
        r_flag:
          description: |-
            R-Flag: Re-advertisement Flag. 
            If set, then the prefix to which this Prefix-SID is attached has been propagated by the router 
            from either another level (i.e., from Level-1 to Level-2 or the opposite) or redistribution (e.g., from another protocol).
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 3
        n_flag: 
          description: |-
            N-Flag: Node-SID flag.  
            If set, then the Prefix-SID refers to the router identified by the prefix. 
            Typically, the N-Flag is set on Prefix-SIDs that are attached to a router loopback address. 
            The N-Flag is set when the Prefix-SID is a Node-SID as described in [RFC8402].
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 4
        p_flag: 
          description: |-
            P-Flag: No-PHP (No Penultimate Hop-Popping) Flag.
            If set, then the Prefix-SID refers to the router identified by the prefix. 
            Typically, the N-Flag is set on Prefix-SIDs that are attached to a router loopback address. 
            The N-Flag is set when the Prefix-SID is a Node-SID as described in [RFC8402].
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 5
        e_flag: 
          description: |-
            E-Flag: Explicit-Null Flag.
            If set, any upstream neighbor of the Prefix-SID originator MUST replace the Prefix-SID with a Prefix-SID 
            that has an Explicit NULL value (0 for IPv4 and 2 for IPv6) before forwarding the packet.
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 6
        l_flag:
          description: |-
            The local flag.  If set, then the value/index carried by
            the Prefix-SID has local significance and the Prefix SID is from "srgb_ranges" under IsisSR.Srlb under Isis.RouterCapability.
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 7
        algorithm:
          description: |-
            The Isis may use various algorithms when calculating
            reachability to other nodes or to prefixes attached to these
            nodes.
