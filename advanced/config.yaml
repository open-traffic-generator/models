            Enabling this option could possibly change the packet payload as 
            implementations may add instrumentation values to identify which 
            flow a packet is associated with.

            store_forward:
            The time interval starting when the last bit of the frame leaves the
            sending port and ending when the first bit of the frame is seen on
            the receiving port (LIFO).  This is based on the RFC 1242 standard.


            cut_through:
            The time interval starting when the first bit of the frame leaves
            the sending port and ending when the first bit of the frame is seen
            on the receiving port (FIFO).  This is based on the RFC 1242
