          description: >-
            A custom packet header defined as a string of hex bytes.
            The string MUST contain sequence of valid hex bytes.
            Spaces or colons can be part of the bytes but will be discarded.
            This packet header can be used in multiple places in the packet.

            One or more metric tags can be used to enable tracking portion of or all bits
            in a corresponding header field for metrics per each applicable value.
            These would appear as tagged metrics in corresponding flow metrics.
