        Top-level container for BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) configuration.
        BMP, as defined in RFC 7854, provides a mechanism to monitor BGP sessions.
        This configuration pertains to the device when acting as a BMP Monitor /server,
        listening for connections from BGP speakers (routers) acting as BMP clients.
        BMP is unidirectional, meaning the monitoring station only receives information; it doesn't send commands to or control the monitored router.

        This means that BMP Server will not initiate the TCP connection but wait for the BMP client it is configured to accept connection from 
        to initiate the connection.
