            as_seq is the most common type of AS_PATH PA, it contains the 
            list of ASNs starting with the most recent ASN being added read 
            from left to right.

            The other three AS_PATH types are used for Confederations
            - AS_SET is the type of AS_PATH attribute that summarizes routes using
            using the aggregate-address command, allowing AS_PATHs to be 
            summarized in the update as well.
            - AS_CONFED_SEQ gives the list of ASNs in the path starting with the 
            most recent ASN to be added reading left to right
            - AS_CONFED_SET will allow summarization of multiple AS PATHs to be 
            sent in BGP Updates.
