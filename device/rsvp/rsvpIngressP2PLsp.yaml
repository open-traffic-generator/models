        tunnel_id:
          description: >-
            The Tunnel ID of the RSVP LSP. Carried in the SESSION object in Path Messages.

        refresh_interval:
          description: >-
             The time in seconds between successive transmissions of PATH Refreshes. 
             The actual refresh interval is jittered by upto 50%.
             There is no specification specified maximum value. For clarity, setting the maximum to 1 hour. 
          type: integer
          default: 30

          maximum: 3600
        timeout_multiplier:
          description: >-
             The number of missed RESV refreshes after which a recieving node should consider the LSP state to have timed out.
             There is no specification specified maximum value. Setting the maximum allowed value to 10.

        backup_lsp_id:
          description: >-
             The LSP id that will be used when creating a Make-Before-Break LSP when the active LSP is using lsp_id.
             If the active LSP on which Make-Before-Break is being done is using the backup_lsp_id, the new LSP created will toggle to 
             use the lsp_id instead.
          type: integer

          maximum: 65535
        lsp_switchover_delay:
          description: >-
            The amount of delay in milliseconds that an implementation should wait for before switching traffic to the new LSP created after 
            a Make-Before-Break is done on an LSP. The default value is 0 which means to switch immediately.
            An implementation should support a minimum delay value of at least 50ms .
            There is no specification specified maximum value. Setting maximum allowed value to 1 minute. 
            If a delay value is supplied which is lesser than the minimum delay value supported, a warning should be provided indicating
            that the minimum value of LSP switchover delay is automatically increased to the supported minimum value.
            This warning should be included in the list of warnings in the 'Response.Warning' attribute sent in the SetConfig 'Success' Response.
