      description: >-
        The Extended Communities Attribute is a optional BGP attribute,defined in RFC4360 with the Type Code 16. 
        Community and Extended Communities  attributes are utilized to trigger routing decisions, 
        such as acceptance, rejection,  preference, or redistribution. 
        An extended community is an 8-Bytes value.It is divided into two main parts. 
        The first 2 Bytes of the community  encode a type and optonal sub-type field.
        The last 6 bytes (or 7 bytes for types without a sub-type) carry a unique set of data in a  format defined by the type and optional sub-type field. 
        Extended communities provide a larger  range for grouping or categorizing communities.
