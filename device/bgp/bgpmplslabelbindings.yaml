        BGP may be used to advertise that a particular node (N) has bound a particular MPLS label, or a particular sequence of MPLS labels, 
        to a particular address prefix.
        This is done by sending a Multiprotocol BGP UPDATE message with with an MP_REACH_NLRI attribute. 
        The Network Address of Next Hop field of that attribute contains an IP address of node N.
