        Container for BGP route ranges.

        This container has the following optional sub containers:
        Device.BgpRRAdvanced (TBD)
        Device.BgpCommunity 
        Device.BgpExtCommunity (TBD)
        Device.BgpLargeCommunity (TBD)
        Device.BgpClusters (TBD)
        Device.BgpAddPath
        Device.BgpASPath

      type: object
      properties:
        range_count:
          description: >-
            The number of route ranges per parent BGP device.

            Length of any child pattern is device_count * range_count.

            Example:
            If the device.device_count is 3 and the range_count is 2 this route
            range object will be duplicated twice for every device.

            If creating sequential routes use a range_count of 1 and adjust
            the address_count to the desired number of network addresses.
           
            To create non-sequential routes used in emulating the internet, 
            adjust the range_count to the number of routes in the internet range
            to be emulated, set the address_count to 1 and use addresses.values
            to assign all the internet network addresses. 
          type: integer
          minimum: 1
          default: 1
        address_count:
          description: >-
