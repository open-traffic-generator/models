      description: >-
        The Graceful Restart Capability (RFC 4724) is a BGP capability that can be
        used by a BGP speaker to indicate its ability to preserve its forwarding
        state during BGP restart.
        The Graceful Restart (GR) capability is advertised in OPEN messages sent between BGP peers.
        After a BGP session has been established, and the initial routing update has been completed, 
        an End-of-RIB (Routing Information Base) marker is sent in an UPDATE message to convey information 
        about routing convergence.

            If enabled, Graceful Restart capability is advertised in BGP OPEN messages.

        restart_time:
          description: >-
            This is the estimated duration (in seconds) it will take for the
            BGP session to be re-established after a restart.  This can be
            used to speed up routing convergence by its peer in case
            the BGP speaker does not come back after a restart.

          format: uint32
          maximum: 4096

          description: |-
            If enabled, the "Long-lived Graceful Restart Capability", or "LLGR Capability"
            will be advertised.
            This capability MUST be advertised in conjunction with the Graceful Restart 
            capability.

          default: false
          x-field-uid: 3
        stale_time:
          description: |-
            Duration (in seconds) specifying how long stale information (for the AFI/SAFI) 
            may be retained. This is a three byte field and is applicable 
            only if 'enable_llgr' is set to 'true'.

        enable_notification:
          description: |- 
            If enabled, the N flag will be set in the Graceful Restart capability in the Open message. 
            If both peers in a BGP connection has this enabled, Graceful Restart procedures are performed
            even if the peer goes down due to sending of a Notification Message as per RFC8538.
