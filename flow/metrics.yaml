            additional instrumentation data.

        rx_per_port:
          description: |-
            Enables Rx port level disaggregation with metrics tag name set as "rx_port_name".

    Flow.Latency.Metrics:
      description: |-
        The optional container for per flow latency metric configuration.
      type: object
      properties:
        enable:
          description: |-
            True to enable latency metrics using timestamps.

            Enabling this option may affect the resultant packet payload due to 
            additional instrumentation data.
          type: boolean

          description: |-
            Select the type of latency measurement. The different types of 
            latency measurements are:


            store_forward:
            The time interval starting when the last bit of the frame leaves the
            sending port and ending when the first bit of the frame is seen on
            the receiving port (LIFO).  This is based on the RFC 1242 standard.


            cut_through:
            The time interval starting when the first bit of the frame leaves
            the sending port and ending when the first bit of the frame is seen
            on the receiving port (FIFO).  This is based on the RFC 1242 
            standard.

    Flow.TxRxReplication:
      description: |-
        Tx Rx ratio is the expected number of Rx packets across all Rx ports to the Tx packets
        for the configured flow.

        custom:
          description: |-
            Should be a positive, non-zero value. A custom integer value (>1) can be specified for
            loss calculation for cases when there are multiple destination addresses configured within one flow,
            but DUT is configured to replicate only to a subset of Rx ports. For cases when Tx side generates two
            packets from each source in 1:1 protection mode but only one of the two packets are received by the
            Rx port, we may need to specify a fractional value instead.
          type: number
          format: float
          default: 1.0
          x-field-uid: 4
    Flow.TxRxReplication.Ecmp:
      description: |-
        This is for cases where Rx packet count across all ports is expected to match the Tx packet count.
    Flow.TxRxReplication.RxCount:
      description: |-
        This is for cases where one copy each Tx packet is received on all Rx ports and so the sum total of Rx packets
        received across all Rx ports is a multiple of Rx port count and Tx packets.
