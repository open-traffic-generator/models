    Flow.Latency.Metrics:
      description: |-
        The optional container for per flow latency metric configuration.
      type: object
      properties:
        enable:
          description: |-
            True to enable latency metrics using timestamps.

            Enabling this option may affect the resultant packet payload due to 
            additional instrumentation data.
          type: boolean

        mode:
          description: |-
            Select the type of latency measurement. The different types of 
            latency measurements are:


            store_forward:
            The time interval starting when the last bit of the frame leaves the
            sending port and ending when the first bit of the frame is seen on
            the receiving port (LIFO).  This is based on the RFC 1242 standard.


            cut_through:
            The time interval starting when the first bit of the frame leaves
            the sending port and ending when the first bit of the frame is seen
            on the receiving port (FIFO).  This is based on the RFC 1242 
            standard.
          type: string
          default: store_forward

    Flow.Predefined.Tags:
      description: |-
        List of predefined flow tracking options, outside packet fields, that can be enabled.
      type: object
      properties:
        rx_name:
          description: |-
            Enables Rx port or lag level disaggregation with predefined metrics tag name set as "rx_name".
            The Rx port / lag names can be found under tagged_metrics tag names in flow metrics response.
          type: boolean
          default: false
          x-field-uid: 1
    Flow.RxTxRatio:
      description: |-
        Rx Tx ratio is the ratio of expected number of Rx packets across all Rx ports to the Tx packets
        for the configured flow. It is a factor by which the Tx packet count is multiplied to calculate
        the sum of expected Rx packet count, across all Rx ports. This will be used to calculate loss
        percentage of flow at aggregate level.
      type: object
      properties:
        choice:
          type: string
          default: value
          x-field-uid: 1
          x-enum:
            rx_count:
              x-field-uid: 1
            value:
              x-field-uid: 2
        rx_count:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Flow.RxTxRatio.RxCount'
          x-field-uid: 2
        value:
          description: |-
            Should be a positive, non-zero value. The default value of 1, is when the Rx packet count across
            all ports is expected to match the Tx packet count. A custom integer value (>1) can be specified for
            loss calculation for cases when there are multiple destination addresses configured within one flow,
            but DUT is configured to replicate only to a subset of Rx ports. For cases when Tx side generates two
            packets from each source in 1:1 protection mode but only one of the two packets are received by the
            Rx port, we may need to specify a fractional value instead.
          type: number
          format: float
          default: 1.0
          x-field-uid: 3
    Flow.RxTxRatio.RxCount:
      description: |-
        This is for cases where one copy of Tx packet is received on all Rx ports and so the sum total of Rx packets
        received across all Rx ports is a multiple of Rx port count and Tx packets.
