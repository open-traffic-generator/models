            AS sequence is the most common type of AS_PATH, it contains the  list
            of ASNs starting with the most recent ASN being added read  from left
            to right.

            The other three AS_PATH types are used for Confederations
            - AS_SET is the type of AS_PATH attribute that summarizes routes using
            using the aggregate-address command, allowing AS_PATHs to be  summarized
            in the update as well.
            - AS_CONFED_SEQ gives the list of ASNs in the path starting with the  most
            recent ASN to be added reading left to right
            - AS_CONFED_SET will allow summarization of multiple AS PATHs to be  sent
            in BGP Updates.
