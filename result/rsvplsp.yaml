        This contains the list of Record Route Object(RRO) objects associated with the traffic engineering tunnel. The 
        Record Route Object(RRO) is used in RSVP-TE to record the route traversed by the LSP. The RRO might be present in both  
        Path message and Resv message, the RRO stores the IP addresses of the routers that the traffic engineering tunnel 
        traversed and also the label generated and distributed by the routers. The RROs in the Resv message mirrors that of 
        the Path message, the only difference is that the RRO in a Resv message records the path information in the reverse 
        direction.
